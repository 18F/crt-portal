# DOJ CRT Portal Management Repo

The CRT Portal is the project behind [civilrights.justice.gov](https://civilrights.justice.gov/). This is an online tool to make it easier for the public to report a civil rights violation. It also helps DOJ staff quickly and accurately respond to these reports.

The issues in this repo are used to populate the project board, [CRT Portal Management](https://github.com/usdoj-crt/crt-portal-management/projects/1)

The code for this project is located in [usdoj-crt-portal](https://github.com/usdoj-crt/crt-portal). That repo also houses the documentation for the project.
